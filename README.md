# SMART GREENHOUSE

Ever imagined when you are out for a weekend or work-related stuff, who is going to take care of your lovely plants?
Leaving it at neighbour's place might not be that good idea. How about automating this task. This SMART GREENHOUSE is designed to do the same


## GETTING STARTED

 To deploy this project you will need:

 Any IDE, preferred is ARDUINO IDE, here you can easily compile and run the code

 Some hardware devices like soil moisture sensor, DHT temperature and humidity sensory

 Micro-controller boards NODEMCU and a LCD

 Relay boards to turn ON or OFF the light and motorpump inside greenhouse
 
 Actuators such as cooling fan, water pump and LED for taking desired actions to control the plant growth
## Deployment

To deploy this project 

First make the circuit connections

Then compile the receiving code and sensor code in IDE and run the program. Make sure you have selected the right board and port while compiling. 

You will need a ubidots account for creating and controlling the variables. 
STEM UBIDOTS is best for hosting personal projects (especially for students to tinker with their IOT projects)
